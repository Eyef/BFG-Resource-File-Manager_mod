|Byte       |Size     |Swaped|Description                                                            |
|-----------|:-------:|:----:|----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|0x0        |4        | Yes  |The file's "magic" identifier (0xD000000D)                             |
|0x4        |4        | Yes  |The table of Contents offset (point to the end of the data) (tocoffset)|
|0x8        |4        | Yes  |The byte length of the Table of Contents (tocsize)                     |
|tocoffset  |4        | Yes  |The number of files inside the resource file                           |
|tocoffset+4|tocsize-4| No   |Table of Contents                                                      |
|tocsize-4  |4        | No   |Dummy value (just a zero)                                              |

Each Table of Contents entry is consist of the following

|Byte             |Size           |Swaped|Description                                       |
|-----------------|:-------------:|:----:|-------------------------------------------------:|
|0x0              |4              | No   |The filename's length                             |
|0x4              |filename length| No   |The filename                                      |
|filename length  |4              | Yes  |The file's offset (point at the start of the file)|
|filename length+4|4              | Yes  |The size of the file (in bytes)                   |

On both tables if swaped is 'Yes' it means that the first and last bytes are switched as much as and the 2nd and 3rd bytes between them.

The DOOM 3 BFG .resources file format file size is limited due to it's usage of 32-bit integers for offset and size representations. 
That limits the file size to ~3GB, while the engine index is having performace issues with .resources > 1GB.

In the end of the file there is a tailing zero that is accounted in the table of contents size.
